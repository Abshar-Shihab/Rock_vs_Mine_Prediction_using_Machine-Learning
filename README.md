# Rock_vs_Mine_Prediction_using_Machine-Learning
This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning project for classifying sonar signals as either rocks or mines. The project uses a **Logistic Regression** model to achieve this classification, leveraging Python and popular machine learning libraries such as `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, and `numpy`.

## Project Overview

Sonar signals can be used to detect and classify objects underwater, distinguishing between metal objects like mines and natural formations such as rocks. This project uses a dataset of sonar returns to build and train a logistic regression model that can accurately predict whether a signal corresponds to a rock or a mine.

### Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the **Sonar dataset**, which consists of 208 samples with 60 features each, representing energy measurements at various angles. The labels are categorical with:
- `R` for rocks
- `M` for mines

Each feature corresponds to the strength of a sonar return at different frequencies.

### Objective

- **Predict** whether the sonar return signals correspond to a rock or a mine.
- **Evaluate** the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.


### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `scikit-learn`


## Results

The logistic regression model should be evaluated based on various metrics. Typical performance indicators include:
- **Accuracy**: How often the model correctly classifies samples.
- **Confusion Matrix**: A table that displays the number of correct and incorrect predictions.
- **Classification Report**: Provides precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each class.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the use of logistic regression for binary classification problems. The sonar signal dataset provides a real-world application of machine learning techniques to distinguish between natural and man-made objects.

## Future Work

Potential future improvements:
- Experimenting with different models (e.g., Support Vector Machine, Random Forest).
- Hyperparameter tuning for optimized performance.
- Cross-validation for more robust evaluation.
