# Rock_vs_Mine_Prediction_using_Machine-Learning
This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning project for classifying sonar signals as either rocks or mines. The project uses a Logistic Regression model to achieve this classification, leveraging Python and popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and numpy.
